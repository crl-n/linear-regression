# Linear Regression From Scratch
A simple linear regression library written in C with a Python API.

For now the library is capable of univariate linear regression only.

## Using the Python API
To use the Python API simply import LinearRegressionModel from lib_linear_reg.py. Use the train() method to train the model, giving it two lists of integers (one for each variable). Once the model has been trained use the predict() method to create a prediction.

Check out main.py for an example of how to use the Python API.
